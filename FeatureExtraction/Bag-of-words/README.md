All the machine learning algorithms work on number vectors. To convert text(sentence) to vectors, we can use a technique called Bag of the words.

Bag of words model is to extract features from text. The way it does this is by counting the frequency of words in a document. The output of the bag of words model is a frequency vector.

Steps:
1. defining the vocabulary
2. use the vocabulary vector to convert sentences into a frequency vector based on the vocabulary

The result is a numerical vector which can be utilized as inputs in the various machine learning algorithms for classification.
