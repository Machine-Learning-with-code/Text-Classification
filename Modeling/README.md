In this, we will create various classification models which will take the vectors generated from Feature extraction, and output the vectors for the output classes.

Various modeling techniques are:
1. Naive Bayes   
2. Support Vector Machine   
3. Basic LSTM


For Naive-Bayes, results are:
| Feature Extraction/ <br> Cleaning/ <br> Dimensionality Reduction | Bag-of-words  |
| --- | ----------- |
| No cleaning | |
| Removing Stopwords | |
